convert unicode to LaTeX

This script will convert unicode to a suitable LaTeX representation.

- It will convert accents, e.g. √®  ‚Üí \\`e
  or ≈© ‚Üí \\~{u}
  or √á  ‚Üí \\c{C} .
  It will work fine   both for the single codepoint √á that is U+00C7 ;
  and for the combining version CÃß  that is  U+0043  followed by U+0327

- It will also convert multiple accents ·π©  ‚Üí \\.{\\d{s}}

- It will expand ligatures Ô¨É ‚Üí ffi

- It will expand fractions ‚Öñ ‚Üí \\sfrac{2}{5}
  (this needs package `xfrac`)

- It will convert small characters such as Ôπ¶Ôπñ

- It will convert subscripts r‚Çê t·µ™ ‚Üí r_{a} t_{\\chi}

- And superscripts  0‚Å∫ ‚Üí 0^{+}

- It will convert math symbols, e.g.  ‚à© ‚Üí \\cap

- It will convert greek letters œë ‚Üí \\vartheta .

- It will express fonts, e.g.  ‚ÖÖ ‚Üí \\symbbit{D} .

The aim is that the output be pure ASCII; but some characters
such as  √¶  are currently not converted: in that
case the output should be compatible with standard `LaTeX`
by using `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`

If instead conversions such as  `‚ÖÖ ‚Üí \\symbbit{D}`
are happening, then the resulting LaTeX code
will need `xelatex` or `lualatex` with packages
`fontspec` and `unicode-math`.

Similarly if some particular unicode are used, such
as ‚áé that will be converted to `\\nLeftrightarrow`

latex2unicode
=============
This script will convert  LaTeX to unicode.

With the --greek arguments,
  it will convert greek letters, \\alpha ‚Üí ùõº

With the --math arguments,
  it will convert math symbols, e.g.  \\cap ‚Üí ‚à© .

Issues
------

Currently accents are always converted using the non-math representation,
for example √ô becomes `\~u` but in math-mode it should be  `\tilde u`


Similarly the conversion of greek letters should be differentiated
 inside and outside mathematical environments.
